You are improving the blog page titled “Smart Agriculture: AI-Driven Soil Analysis for Better Crop Yields” for NIYIBIZI Jean Pierre,
Geotechnical Engineer, Researcher & CEO of GEO-HOME SERVICES LTD (Rwanda).

The site is static (HTML/CSS/JS) and hosted on GitHub Pages.
I have already provided blog-ai-driven-soil-analysis.html.
Now, improve it visually and structurally using the following image plan and layout adjustments.

Image Integration

Insert these images in the following locations and add descriptive alt text for SEO:

Hero Section (top):
./assets/img/blog-ai-soil-analysis/ai-soil-analysis-rwanda.jpg
Alt: “Farmer in Rwanda using soil sensor and tablet for AI-driven analysis.”

Under ‘The Science Behind AI-Driven Soil Analysis’:
./assets/img/blog-ai-soil-analysis/soil-sensor-device.jpg
Alt: “Close-up of soil sensor measuring moisture and nutrients.”

Under ‘How It Works in Practice’:
./assets/img/blog-ai-soil-analysis/machine-learning-dashboard.jpg
Alt: “AI dashboard analyzing soil data for crop recommendations.”

Between ‘Benefits for Farmers’ and ‘Future of Smart Agriculture in Rwanda’:
./assets/img/blog-ai-soil-analysis/geohome-lab-analysis.jpg
Alt: “GEO-HOME SERVICES LTD field testing and soil sampling.”

End of Article / Before Footer:
./assets/img/blog-ai-soil-analysis/rwanda-farmland-drone.jpg
Alt: “Aerial view of Rwandan farmlands showcasing precision agriculture.”

Each image should:

Be centered or span full width with max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 6px;

Include <figure> and <figcaption> for professional presentation.

Content & Layout Enhancements

Add subtle section dividers or horizontal rules between major sections.

Increase line spacing (1.7em) for readability.

Add a highlighted quote box style for the GEO-HOME SERVICES LTD quote.

Apply a light box-shadow on images for depth.

Use a two-column layout for the “How It Works” steps on desktop view.

Make sure the blog is fully responsive and images resize gracefully on mobile.

SEO & Accessibility

Confirm every image includes descriptive alt text.

Keep only one <h1> tag (the article title).

Ensure each section uses logical heading hierarchy (H2 > H3 > H4).

Maintain schema.org markup and meta tags.

Keep file paths relative for GitHub Pages (./assets/...).

Output Expected

Updated HTML with all <figure> image tags and improved formatting.

Minimal CSS additions (optional inline or extend /assets/css/style.css with .blog-image and .quote-box).

Ensure mobile responsiveness and image optimization (<200KB).
